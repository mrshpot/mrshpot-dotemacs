** skip shebang line when sending to inferior buffer (issue #61)

** rewrite lua-send-region to use "loadstring" rather than "dofile"
   - sending code to processes on remote hosts is now supported
   - stack traces for errors occurred in sent code point to proper lines in files
   - script path is preserved when sending code (issue #55)
   - no more hang ups when waiting for input (issue #48) or after sending code
     with no output (issue #60)

** increase consistency with Emacs ecosystem to improve user experience
   - fix character syntax hacks: '.' is now punctuation and '_' is now symbol
   - remove number highlighting
   - font-lock "nil", "true" and "false" as constants rather than keywords

** make builtin font-locking more stable, enable it after ".." operator

** add missing modulo operator (%) to line-continuation tokens

** fix interaction with electric-pair-mode (issue #54)

** when unindenting block-close tokens consider all of them, not just the first one
     x = foobar('arg1', function ()
                  print('foobar')
     end)
     ^ this line starts with two block-close tokens and is unindented
     accordingly


* Release rel-20130419
** highlight hash-bang line as comment

** make lua-mode-hook editable via customize

** fix several indentation bugs & quirks

** fix lua-send-proc not to send previous function when point is at the beginning of a function

** derive lua-mode from prog-mode for Emacs24

** add font-locking for builtins and numeric constants

** fix a bug causing exponential complexity in a keyword matching regexp

** add more unindentation cases for block-closing tokens

** improve multiline highlighting via font-lock-syntactic-keywords
   This should make font-locking of multiline literals more fluent & stable.  And
   it becomes customizable via standard font-lock configuration

** properly fontify variable definitions in 'local ...' & 'for ...'
   Also, perform some basic syntax verification in those lines.  Multi-line
   constructs not supported yet.

** fix indentation for blocks starting on continued lines
     local foo =
        {
           bar,
           baz
        }  ^
           1. these lines should be indented properly now
     ^
     2. the following lines should be unindented properly now

** extend imenu-generic-expression
   Now it matches 'foo = function(...)' function definitions
